# Intro To Web Dev 👩‍💻

## Pre Reqs 💻
- Have a [repl.it](https://replit.com) account

That's it!

## Step One: HTML 🧚‍♀️

There's a whole history of HTML and how the web came to be that a lot of web dev courses in school go over before they let you start making stuff, but I think that is boring, so we're just going to start coding! (If you are a history nerd, though, you can come back later and read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) wikipedia page if you are *really* interested. 

For now, all you need to know if that HTML is kind of like the skeleton of the web. It makes things visible, but not pretty.

- Head [here](https://replit.com/new/html) to get started! 

You should see something like this: 
<img width="1440" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112422033-3db84380-8cfe-11eb-9a56-a83573f9f9d2.png">

- You'll then want to name your project something like ```personal_website``` or ```web_dev_workshop``` so that you know what it is when you come back to it later!

Here is where you can rename it!

<img width="444" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 09 47 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112422141-6b9d8800-8cfe-11eb-9dc1-8e171b9dd00b.png">

You should see something like this after you hit ```create repl```. 

<img width="1429" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 12 07 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112422358-be773f80-8cfe-11eb-81d4-fdb7b4b5d9c2.png">

If you look closely at to the left, you should see some HTML, which is all the stuff enclosed in ```<>```. 

Let's take a closer look at the HTML. 

<img width="147" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 15 17 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112422640-2f1e5c00-8cff-11eb-81b5-ae183c823f44.png">

Here we can see the ```DOCTYPE``` declaration, which is essentially just "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. 

Right below that we can see the opening ```<html>``` tag, which is what **all** of our html code needs to be enclosed in. 

<img width="73" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 16 29 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112422741-5e34cd80-8cff-11eb-89a0-16e5f9671574.png">

Beneath that we can see our opening ```<head>``` tag, along with some code that has been autogenerated for us. 

<img width="462" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 17 47 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112422856-8a504e80-8cff-11eb-9e38-c5d5df0baf17.png">

The majority of this code just makes sure that the html renders correctly, despite the size of the device, but don't worry about that for now! 

An important declaration in here is the ```<head>``` element! This is the element that dictates what text be displayed on these fun things. 

<img width="1437" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 20 23 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112423037-e5824100-8cff-11eb-808e-0b678ec8221a.png">

The line below that that begins with ```<link``` is the line of code that links our html page to the css code. CSS is another language that is used to style things on the web. I like to think of it as the clothes on the skeleton that is HTML. 
 
<img width="372" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 26 37 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112423518-c506b680-8d00-11eb-980a-037a1ae21bdd.png">

Here we can see the opening and closing```<body>```tags. This is where the majority of our code will go when we make our webpage today. Inside of them you can see the line of code that starts with ```<script```. This is the line of code that is linking our HTML page to our JavaScript file. I like to think of JavaScript as the organs and flesh of our website, they are held together by the HTML, and made to look nice with CSS, but are ultimately what gives the site functionality and interactivity.

<img width="135" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 31 58 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112423924-845b6d00-8d01-11eb-8498-c3ff12dc6573.png">

Finally, we can see the closing tag for our ```<html``` element. Almost all elements need a closing tag, with only a few exceptions! 

Okay, now that we know what is going on in this ```index.html``` document, let's start coding! 

- In between the```<title>```tags, replace ```repl.it``` with your first and last name, so that it looks something like this: 

<img width="311" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 35 19 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112424178-fc299780-8d01-11eb-9cd1-409cb25c1ff8.png">

- Now, let's see our code working! Click the button on the far right and you should get a new empty window pop up. 

<img width="582" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 36 52 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112424320-33984400-8d02-11eb-82b2-225cf962ee28.png">

Well, not a completely empty window, you should see something link this: 

<img width="198" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 37 19 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112424362-43178d00-8d02-11eb-9b8b-a753a1ccc6c5.png">

Now let's add some actual content to the page. 

- Add the following code beneath the ```<script>``` element in the body ```<h1> Your Name Here </h1>```

We just added a header element to your web page, which means that the HTML will automatically style it a little bit, making it bigger and bolder than normal text. 

- Refresh your empty window from before, and you should see something like this:  
<img width="439" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 39 49 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112424534-9d185280-8d02-11eb-99f8-462e59a0e7dc.png">

Now, let's add a picture of yourself to your webpage. 

- Upload a picture of yourself to repl.it by clicking on this 

<img width="256" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 43 47 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112424881-2af43d80-8d03-11eb-8074-08644f441cc2.png">

Once you have uploaded your picture, you should see it pop up in the side bar next to your ```index.html``` file, your ```script.js``` file, and your ```style.css``` file. 

- Next, you want to write the following code underneath your ```<h1>``` element. ```  <img src="name of your file" alt="description of your picture"> ```. Make sure that you have the correct spelling of your picture file and the right extension (for example .png or .jpg). The ```alt``` part of the ```img``` element is important because that is the text that will show up on your web page if the code can't find your image.

<img width="494" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 48 30 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112425296-d3a29d00-8d03-11eb-8beb-a5f4a46ad4a1.png">

An example of when the image isn't found. 

This is what your webpage should resemble at this point. Make sure to refresh your webpage!

<img width="732" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 49 17 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112425364-efa63e80-8d03-11eb-80a5-e45523fd38db.png">


- Now let's add a description of yourself to your webpage. Write out a few sentence description of yourself and enclose it in a ```<p>``` element. This element is a paragraph element and is meant for - you guessed it - paragraphs! 

Code that looks like this: 

<img width="471" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 56 17 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112425907-eb2e5580-8d04-11eb-9bab-464b3244c2b7.png">

Should look like this after refreshing: 

<img width="1420" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 12 56 50 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112425943-ff725280-8d04-11eb-9174-fcb758f7be04.png">

Okay, now that we added some text, let's add some links !

- Below your ```<p>``` element, write code some code like this (but with the link replaced with your instagram) : ``` <a href = "https://instagram.com/gmi3sner" target = "_blank"> check out my instagram </a> ```

You should see something like this after reloading: 

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 1 01 06 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112426240-97703c00-8d05-11eb-85f4-d1ea235af65e.png">
 
 If you click on ```check out my instagram```, your instagram account should open in a new window! If you don't want the link to open in a new window, delete the ``` target = "_blank" ``` part of the link element. 
 

 - Underneath the ```<a>``` element, add the following element ```<ul></ul>```. You just created an unordered list, but there's nothing inside for you to see yet. Inside your ```<ul>``` element, add the following code ```<li> red </li> <li> orange </li> <li> yellow </li>```. 

You should see a bulleted list appear with the colors listed! Now, replace those colors in the list items with three of your hobbies. Above the ```<ul>``` element, add an ```<h2>``` element that reads 'my hobbies'. 

- Underneath the unordered list, let's make an ordered list by adding the following code : ```<ol> <li> your favorite song </li> <li> 2nd favorite song </li> <li> 3rd favorite song </li> </ol>```. Above that add an ```<h2>``` element that reads 'my favorite songs'. You should see a numbered list with your favorite songs! 
 
 ## Part Two : CSS 💃
 So now we have a webpage, but let's be honest, it's pretty ugly! So let's make it pretty, with CSS! 
 
 - On the left, click on the item that reads ```style.css```, so we can start writing some css. Your CSS document should be blank, unline the HTML document. 
 
 - Write the code ```body{text-align:center;}``` in the CSS file. 

What this does is center everything that is in the ```<body>``` element. The ```body``` before the curly brackets is called a selector and what the CSS is applied to. Let's take a look!

<img width="1427" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 1 06 33 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112426675-59bfe300-8d06-11eb-98a7-0360cfec1bf9.png">


- Okay, now copy paste the following code into the top of your CSS document, above the ```body``` from before : ```@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;600&display=swap');``` This is going to import a certain font from a Font API : [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Next we need to write the following code **inside** our body selector: ```font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;``` 

The entirety of our CSS should look something like this: 

<img width="442" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 1 18 13 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112427675-fa62d280-8d07-11eb-8e82-74db0d1086be.png">

If you refresh your webpage again, this is what it should look like: 

<img width="1424" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 1 11 54 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112427137-19ad3000-8d07-11eb-9bc9-05ced881d71a.png">

It's coming together, but our paragraph text is a bit wide. 

- Next add the following code beneath the ```body``` selector in your CSS : ```p{ margin-left: 7%; margin-right: 7%;}``` This creates margin for the p element on both the right and left side that is 7% of the screen width. 

Ta-Da!

<img width="1317" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 1 14 52 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112427403-832d3e80-8d07-11eb-814a-d90b9b25f2e9.png">

Next! On to styling the link: 

- Type the following code beneath the ```p``` selector: ``` a{text-decoration: none;font-weight: 600;color: black;}``` This gets rid of the default line underneath the link, bolds the text, and changes the color from the default blue to black. 

<img width="1290" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 1 19 51 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112427809-3433d900-8d08-11eb-88a4-9e5a24af73e5.png">

Now, I want to make the Heading and the link text bigger, so I'll do that by adding the following code: 

<img width="235" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 2 27 12 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112434457-9d6c1a00-8d11-11eb-823a-4450f8bda1c4.png">

This code alters the font size to be number times the orginal font size (which is by default 16). 

After refreshing, your page should look like this: 

<img width="1354" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 2 26 51 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112434426-91805800-8d11-11eb-9ac9-634200a0110b.png">

We need some color in this webpage! Let's try adding a background color! 

- Go [here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) and find a color you think would be a good background.
- Then copy the hex code (including the #)

<img width="622" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 2 29 49 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112434797-fb006680-8d11-11eb-8f2f-d69e6d01f1ad.png">

- in your CSS file, add the following line to your body selector ```background: your color;```

After refreshing your page should look something like this: 

<img width="1347" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 2 31 05 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112435004-28e5ab00-8d12-11eb-85f1-5f8e94023471.png">

- Next, let's style the lists! They look a bit wonky now, but try adding the following CSS to your code: ``` ul{margin-left: 40%;text-align:left;} ol{margin-left: 40%;text-align:left;} ```

This code will give the ordered and unordered list a margin of the left of 40%, and align the text left so there isn't a weird space in between the bullets or numbers and the text. 

Here is what it should look like: 

<img width="1140" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-25 at 2 42 19 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51331370/112436408-baa1e800-8d13-11eb-8614-31c1fede9b58.png">


Now I will set you free to work on your own code! But I do have a few challenges for you when you're coding: 

- add 2 more ```<p>``` elements with some more information on who you are and what you do 
- try adding an ```<a>``` element inside a ```<p>``` element to link to something you talk about in your bio (school, work, your dog's twitter)
- add another picture! 


When you are completed, send the link to your webpage to [this](https://forms.gle/81e88PGn97ZnwtUC6) google form. (The link can be found in the URL bar where you have been looking at your webpage).
